A web-based java/tomcat software to estimate the energy expenditure and
energy system contributions during the exercise using the measurement
of oxygen uptake and the blood lactate accumulation.

The corresponding research paper is [Bertuzzi et al. (2016).

Contributions during Exercise. PLoS ONE 11 (1):
e0145733](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0145733).

There is a simplistic ansible playbook to install in debian-based systems.
